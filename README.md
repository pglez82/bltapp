# BltApp
## Introduction
This project aims to build a sample application in React Native using GPS location and Bluetooth. We will be able to scan for near devices and store this information in a (https://github.com/pglez82/nodejsrestapi)[webservice] for future use.
We are using React Native to test its capabilities and be able to create an app that will work in Android and IOS. Note: this example has only been tested in Android (real device as the emulator doesn't implement bluetooth).
